		<h3>Encode the form data set </h3>

<p>The names and values of the form data set are then encoded according to the method specified by the enctype attribute of the FORM element. The default encoding is <b>"application/x-www-form-urlencoded"</b>, which is defined as follows:</p>

    <ol><li>Form field names and values are escaped. Space characters are replaced by `+', and then reserved characters are escaped as described in [RFC1738]: Non-alphanumeric characters are replaced by `%HH', a percent sign and two hexadecimal digits representing the ASCII code of the character. Line breaks, as in multi-line text field values, are represented as "CR LF" pairs, i.e., `%0D%0A'.</li>
        <li>The fields are listed in the order they appear in the document with the name separated from the value by `=' and the pairs separated from each other by `&'. Fields with null values may be omitted. In particular, unselected radio buttons and checkboxes should not appear in the encoded data, but hidden fields with value attributes present should.</li> </ol>
